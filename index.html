          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I <br />
          learned were current, if not more so, in the company I <br />
          joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

          “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been
          looking to make a <br />
          transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience
          here. I signed up <br />
          for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
          shortly thereafter. The next <br />
          12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
          completing the course, <br />
          I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at
          a VR startup. ”

          student of theirs <br> who can only say wonderful things <br> about the program.
          The entire <br> curriculum and staff did not <br> disappoint. They were very
          hands-on <br> and I never had to wait long for <br> assistance. The agile team
          project, in <br> particular, was outstanding. It took <br> my learning to the
          next level in a way <br> that no tutorial could ever have. In <br> fact, I’ve
          often referred to it during <br> interviews as an example of my <br> developent
          experience. It certainly <br> helped me land a job as a full-stack <br>
